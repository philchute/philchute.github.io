					Classic strategy game franchises like Command & Conquer, Age of Empires, Dawn of War, 
					Warcraft and Starcraft have seen some excellent remasters and occasionally a new entry, however nothing 
					compares to the ultimate RTS, Rise of Nations. RoN was originally released in 2003, and saw an 
					expansion pack released the next year. The IP was eventually aquired by Microsoft who released 
					a remastered version in 2014, Rise of Nations: Extended Edition, which incorporates the exapansion, 
					allows higher widescreen resolutions, and provides integrated online matchmaking.

					The original Command & Conquer and the first Red Alert have been remastered and are available on Steam with 
					HD graphics, expanded soundtrack, and all the extra missions from the expansions and console release.<br>

					Link: <a href="https://cnc.community/">Command & Conquer Community</a> - This website features leaderboards for the 
					remastered edition, as well as instructions on how to play the first several entires in the series. 
					Command & Conquer 3 and Red Alert 3 are available on Steam along with their expansions. They go on sale for $5
					and still hold up well at higher resolutions. This franchise has not seen a solid game since, but hopefully
					the remastered collection can revive these epic games.<br>
					<br>
					Age of Empires received a second HD remaster, available on Steam as Age of Empires: Definitive Edition.<br>
					Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition quickly followed in 2019, containing all previously released content, but 
					has sold with such success that Microsoft has released several new expansions for this 20 year old title. 
					This game continues to be played competitively, remaining more popular than I or III.<br>
					Age of Empires III received its definitive edition in 2000, and again had enough success to warrent new expansions 
					such as the United States and Mexico.<br>
					Age of Empires IV was released in 2021 and is still receiving content and balance updates to perhaps refine this into 
					another classic.<br>
					Microsoft has aquired the rights to Warcraft and Starcraft which could see good remasters or new titles in those franchises as well.<br>
