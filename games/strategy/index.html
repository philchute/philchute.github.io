					Rise of Nations has become the king of the strategy games. Originally released in 2003 followed by an 
					expansion pack released the next year. The IP was eventually acquired by Microsoft who released 
					a remastered version in 2014, Rise of Nations: Extended Edition, which incorporates the expansion, 
					allows higher widescreen resolutions, and provides integrated online matchmaking.

					remastered edition, as well as instructions on how to play the first several entires in the series. <br>
					Command & Conquer 3 and Red Alert 3 are available on Steam along with their expansions. They go on sale for $5
					and still hold up well at higher resolutions. This franchise has not seen a solid game since, but hopefully
					the remastered collection can revive these epic games.<br>

					Age of Empires received a second HD remaster, available on Steam as Age of Empires: Definitive Edition.<br>
					Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition quickly followed in 2019, containing all previously released content, but 
					has sold with such success that Microsoft has released several new expansions for this 20 year old title. 
					This game continues to be played competitively, remaining more popular than I or III.<br>
					Age of Empires III received its definitive edition in 2000, and again had enough success to warrant new expansions 
					such as the United States and Mexico.<br>
					Age of Empires IV was released in 2021 and is still receiving content and balance updates to perhaps refine this into 
					another classic.<br>
					Microsoft has acquired the rights to Warcraft and Starcraft which could see good remasters or new titles in those franchises as well.<br>
